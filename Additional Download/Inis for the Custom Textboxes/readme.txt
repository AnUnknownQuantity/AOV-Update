Disclaimer: All Ini’s within this folder will overwrite your current ini for said character. 
If you have customised ini’s that you wish to keep, make a backup or manually add the textboxes yourself.

Each ini has been edited to have their own canon textbox to better suit the games they were from.

To change the apearance of the textbox for any character open their ini,
and add the line ''chat = Chatxxxx'' for whatever chatbox you desire within the misc folder.
Textboxes are clientside only, meaning they will only show on your screen unless everyone has that particular textbox set to their char ini
If you don't like a textbox, delete it from your ini or your misc folder all-together and you will see the default textbox.
